## 🎯 Post-MVP Strategy (Evidence-Driven)

### Month 2: Evidence-Based Feature Addition
```yaml
Add ONLY if users request (40%+ demand threshold):
  📋 Family/partner sharing expansion
  📋 Category customization options
  📋 Advanced reporting features
  📋 Bank sync provider expansion

Do NOT add until proven demand:
  ❌ Investment tracking (separate concern)
  ❌ Complex AI features (single model first)
  ❌ Advanced categorization (use AI for 30 days first)
  ❌ Subscription billing (freemium model first)
```

### Month 3+: Data-Driven Iteration
```yaml
Analytics-Driven Development:
  ✅ User behavior analysis showing actual feature usage
  ✅ A/B testing for UX improvements and feature validation
  ✅ User interviews for qualitative feedback
  ✅ Performance monitoring and optimization
  ✅ Gradual complexity addition only where evidence supports

Scaling Triggers (Architecture Evolution):
  📋 >1000 active users → Consider Phase 2 architecture
  📋 >3 developers → Enhanced governance processes  
  📋 Cross-slice conflicts → Architecture pattern refinement
  📋 Performance bottlenecks → Optimization strategies
```

### Long-Term Vision (Evidence-Validated)
```yaml
Success Indicators for Continued Development:
  ✅ 70%+ monthly retention (vs industry 23%)
  ✅ Organic user growth through word-of-mouth
  ✅ Positive user feedback on stress reduction
  ✅ Feature requests aligned with research findings

Sustainable Growth Strategy:
  ✅ Maintain simplicity as core principle
  ✅ Add complexity only with evidence
  ✅ Focus on user empowerment vs guilt
  ✅ Preserve anti-over-engineering principles
```
