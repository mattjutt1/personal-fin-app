# Product Requirements Document: Personal Financial AI Assistant

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the vision, scope, and high-level requirements for a personal financial management application. The core purpose of this application is to leverage empirical financial data over time to systematically create an automated financial plan and streamline bookkeeping for a single user.

## 2. Product Vision & Goal

To empower the user with an intelligent, multi-agentic financial software that autonomously analyzes personal financial data, generates actionable financial plans, and automates bookkeeping tasks, providing a clear, legitimate roadmap for their financial life.

## 3. Target User

*   **Primary User:** Matt (the individual user).
*   **Needs:** Automated financial planning, systematic bookkeeping, data-driven insights, and a personalized financial roadmap.

## 4. Key Features (High-Level)

### 4.1. Data Ingestion & Management
*   **Financial Data Import:** Ability to import empirical financial data from various sources (e.g., CSV, bank statements, credit card statements) over extended periods.
*   **Transaction Storage:** Secure and organized storage of all imported and manually entered financial transactions.
*   **Data Visualization:** Basic dashboards and reports to visualize financial trends, income, expenses, and net worth over time.

### 4.2. Multi-Agentic Financial Planning (AI/ML Core)
*   **Supervisor Agent Pattern:** The core AI/ML system will operate based on a supervisor agent pattern, orchestrating specialized sub-agents.
*   **Automated Financial Plan Generation:** Based on ingested data, user-defined goals (future feature), and financial principles, the system will generate a personalized, actionable financial plan.
*   **Goal-Oriented Planning:** (Future) Ability to define financial goals (e.g., saving for a down payment, retirement) and have the agents incorporate these into the plan.
*   **Scenario Analysis:** (Future) Ability to simulate different financial scenarios and their impact on the plan.

### 4.3. Systematic Bookkeeping
*   **Automated Transaction Categorization:** AI-driven categorization of transactions based on patterns, user rules, and learning.
*   **Reconciliation Assistance:** Tools to assist with reconciling accounts and ensuring data accuracy.
*   **Reporting:** Generation of standard financial reports (e.g., income statement, balance sheet, cash flow).

### 4.4. User Interface (Web Application)
*   **Dashboard:** A personalized overview of financial health and key metrics.
*   **Transaction View:** A clear interface to view, edit, and manually categorize transactions.
*   **Plan View:** A dedicated section to display the generated financial plan, its progress, and recommendations.
*   **Settings:** Configuration options for data sources, financial goals, and agent behavior.

## 5. Non-Goals

*   **Enterprise Solution:** This is strictly a personal application, not designed for multi-user, team, or enterprise-level financial management.
*   **Public SaaS:** Not intended to be a publicly available software-as-a-service product.
*   **Direct Bank Integration (Initial Phase):** Direct API integration with financial institutions is out of scope for the initial build to simplify development and focus on core logic. Data import will be file-based.
*   **Investment Trading Platform:** This application will provide financial planning and insights, but will not execute trades or manage investment portfolios directly.

## 6. High-Level Technical Considerations

*   **Frontend:** Next.js (React, TypeScript) for a modern, interactive web UI.
*   **Backend & Database:** Convex for real-time database, serverless functions, and backend logic. This will house the core financial logic and agent orchestration.
*   **Financial Engine (Rust):** Core, performance-critical financial calculations will be implemented in Rust, likely compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) and integrated into Convex functions, or exposed as a microservice if WASM integration proves too complex for specific needs.
*   **AI/ML Framework:** Python will be used for training and potentially running complex AI/ML models, integrated with Convex functions (e.g., via HTTP calls to a separate Python service or through WASM if feasible).
*   **Local-First Data:** Prioritize local data storage and processing where possible, with Convex providing the cloud synchronization and real-time capabilities.

## 7. Future Considerations

*   Integration with external financial APIs (with user consent).
*   Advanced predictive analytics and forecasting.
*   More sophisticated goal tracking and progress visualization.
*   Mobile application (if needed).
