Goodbudget has graphs that are easy and simple to understand. One of them tells you where you spend your money the other tells you how much you spend and how much income you get. Goodbudget has easy-to-understand features and if you don’t understand they took time to create videos on how to learn to use the app well. The app also helps show you how much you spend and save to keep up with your finances well.\n\nHowever, this app isn’t perfect just like everything. One negative about this app is that there is a paywall to get all the features and it can be tricking when first starting. The videos created are also a bit of a problem because they show that the app is very complex and can’t be fully used if not watched. Personally, one thing that bothered me was I needed to pay for an app about budgeting which I think is silly.\n\nI understand that the app is free and a paywall is there for the creators to earn money from it, you can improve on helping a basic user to add a tutorial on what each feature does. This would be very simple to add and will help more people to want to download it for its simple explanation on how to use it. Other than this simple thing I love your app and how you guys were able to make it.\n\n\n    \n\n\n      \n        more",

The beauty of YNAB is that it is flexible and dynamic, and allows you to adjust your spending plan as you need to. I found the program itself is well designed, reliable, and easy to use. The only issues I’ve had were with banks making it hard to set up connectivity. But YNAB did a good job of communicating how they were working to resolve the issues.  In the beginning it does take a few hours to set up categories and get banks connected,  mainly because it is so customizable, but once it is set up it is virtually effortless to maintain. Do watch the tutorials first on how to set it up.  But then  I spend 1 to 3 minutes each morning reviewing the previous days expenditures, and maybe 10 minutes a month reconciling my accounts. It shows monthly and quarterly reports so I can see trends over time. The only tricky bit is understanding how YNAB budgets your credit card purchases. That is not intuitive the way the rest of the program is. But they produce tutorials that explain it well. The web platform is easiest to use for setting up your categories, and for reconciliation. But the phone app is essential for quickly checking your remaining budgets on the go, especially as you get close to your next payday. I highly recommend it for those who want to be in charge of their spending habits.\n\n\n    \n\n\n      \n        more",

          "text": "I’ve been using this for five months now, and this is the best app for a digital version of the old cash envelope system, a la Dave Ramsey. It’s great because some budget categories get spent completely every month to a zero balance, whereas other categories may accumulate over time, like savings, and this app accounts for these growing “envelope” balances - something that every budgeting app I’ve tried lacked. As long as you, and your spouse, enter EVERY transaction, it’s a dream to use. And with the accounts feature turned on you’ll know exactly how much you have at any time. I have bank and credit accounts entered, so I always know their balances at a glance. WHAT IS LACKING: There needs to be a RECONCILE feature in the app for when you need to compare what’s in Goodbudget versus your bank or credit card statements - like a checkbox next to each transaction in the transaction list. It’s frustrating sometimes to try and make sure you’ve got everything entered but have no way to mark what you’ve already verified. Ugh! Also, there needs to be a SEARCH feature in the app to search for specific transactions. There is one for the website but not the app. ——- Get the app!
