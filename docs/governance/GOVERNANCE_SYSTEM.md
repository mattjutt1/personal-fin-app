## ðŸ”„ Integrated Workflows

### 1. Feature Development Workflow

#### Phase 1: Planning & Architecture Review
```bash
# Step 1: Check Current Context
Read: CLAUDE.md â†’ Current status, architectural decisions
Read: PROJECT_ROADMAP.md â†’ Current milestone and priorities
Read: PROJECT_RULES.md â†’ Development constraints and patterns
Read: ATOMIC_VERTICAL_SLICE_HYBRID_GOVERNANCE.md â†’ Architecture compliance

# Step 2: Validate Feature Scope
Check: Anti-over-engineering rules (PROJECT_RULES.md)
Validate: Slice boundaries (ATOMIC_*_GOVERNANCE.md)
Confirm: Roadmap alignment (PROJECT_ROADMAP.md)
Confirm: Human authority needed? (DEVELOPMENT_GOVERNANCE.md)
```

#### Phase 2: Implementation
```bash
# Step 3: Architecture Compliance
Apply: Vertical slice organization (ATOMIC_*_GOVERNANCE.md)
Follow: Code rules (PROJECT_RULES.md)
Implement: Quality gates (DEVELOPMENT_GOVERNANCE.md)

# Step 4: Quality Validation
Run: Architecture compliance checks
Validate: Slice independence tests
Check: Performance within slice
```

#### Phase 3: Completion & Documentation
```bash
# Step 5: Documentation Updates
Update: CLAUDE.md with decisions made
Update: PROJECT_ROADMAP.md with progress and completion
Record: Architecture patterns in governance files
Create: Session summary (SESSION_TEMPLATE.md)

# Step 6: Memory System Update
Run: ./scripts/update-roadmap.sh (automatic roadmap sync)
Follow: MEMORY_UPDATE_GUIDE.md process
Validate: Context consistency across files
```

### 2. Decision Making Workflow

#### When Rules Conflict
```bash
# Escalation Path (DEVELOPMENT_GOVERNANCE.md)
1. Document conflict clearly
2. Present options to human with pros/cons
3. Human decides which principle takes priority
4. Update appropriate governance file
5. Record decision in CLAUDE.md
```

#### Architecture Evolution Triggers
```bash
# Scale Decision Points (ATOMIC_*_GOVERNANCE.md + PROJECT_RULES.md)
Check: >1000 users? â†’ Consider Phase 2 architecture
Check: >3 developers? â†’ Review slice boundaries  
Check: Performance issues? â†’ Validate current phase
Check: Slice conflicts? â†’ Architecture review needed
```

### 3. Quality Gate Integration

#### Pre-Development Gates
- [ ] **PROJECT_RULES.md**: Anti-over-engineering validation
- [ ] **ATOMIC_*_GOVERNANCE.md**: Architecture compliance check
- [ ] **DEVELOPMENT_GOVERNANCE.md**: Human approval if needed
- [ ] **CLAUDE.md**: Context understanding validated

#### During Development Gates
- [ ] **Slice Independence**: No cross-slice business logic
- [ ] **Boundary Compliance**: Clear API interfaces
- [ ] **Performance**: Sub-200ms slice operations
- [ ] **Anti-Patterns**: No red flags from PROJECT_RULES.md

#### Post-Development Gates
- [ ] **Documentation**: CLAUDE.md updated with decisions
- [ ] **Session Recording**: SESSION_TEMPLATE.md completed
- [ ] **Memory Consistency**: All files reflect current state
- [ ] **Architecture Evolution**: Scale triggers evaluated

```bash
1. Run ./scripts/quick-status.sh â†’ Get complete project overview
2. Read PROJECT_ROADMAP.md â†’ Check current milestone and priorities
3. Read CLAUDE.md â†’ Understand current project state
4. Review PROJECT_RULES.md â†’ Remember constraints and patterns
5. Check ATOMIC_*_GOVERNANCE.md â†’ Validate architecture compliance
6. Review pending items from last SESSION_TEMPLATE.md
```

#### During Development
```bash
1. Follow vertical slice organization (ATOMIC_*_GOVERNANCE.md)
2. Apply anti-over-engineering rules (PROJECT_RULES.md)
3. Validate quality gates (DEVELOPMENT_GOVERNANCE.md)
4. Document decisions in real-time
```

#### End of Day
```bash
1. Update CLAUDE.md with progress and decisions
2. Run ./scripts/update-roadmap.sh â†’ Sync progress to roadmap
3. Complete SESSION_TEMPLATE.md for session handoff
4. Check governance file updates needed
5. Run final architecture compliance check
```

### Weekly Review Process

#### Architecture Health Check
```bash
1. Review slice independence (ATOMIC_*_GOVERNANCE.md)
2. Check anti-over-engineering compliance (PROJECT_RULES.md)
3. Validate quality gate effectiveness (DEVELOPMENT_GOVERNANCE.md)
4. Update memory system (MEMORY_UPDATE_GUIDE.md)
```

#### Governance System Maintenance
```bash
1. Check file consistency across all MD files
2. Update cross-references as project evolves
3. Refine rules based on actual experience
4. Document lessons learned in appropriate files
```

## ðŸš¨ Emergency Protocols Integration

### Red Flag Detection System
When any governance file detects violations:

#### From PROJECT_RULES.md (Over-engineering detected)
```bash
1. STOP development immediately
2. Reference DEVELOPMENT_GOVERNANCE.md emergency protocols
3. Document issue in CLAUDE.md 
4. Apply anti-over-engineering remediation
5. Update governance if new pattern discovered
```

#### From ATOMIC_*_GOVERNANCE.md (Architecture violation)
```bash
1. STOP feature development
2. Assess slice boundary violation impact
3. Apply architecture remediation patterns
4. Document in CLAUDE.md decision log
5. Update PROJECT_RULES.md if needed
```

#### From DEVELOPMENT_GOVERNANCE.md (Quality gate failure)
```bash
1. Escalate to human decision maker
2. Document failure and options in CLAUDE.md
3. Apply rollback procedures if needed
4. Update appropriate governance files
5. Create prevention measures
```

### Recovery Procedures
```bash
# Immediate Recovery
1. Stop all development work
2. Assess damage across all governance domains
3. Determine rollback vs fix-forward strategy
4. Get human decision on approach
5. Execute recovery plan

# Post-Recovery
1. Update all affected governance files
2. Document lessons learned in CLAUDE.md
3. Create prevention measures
4. Validate governance system effectiveness
```

## ðŸš€ Evolution Strategy

### As Project Grows
The governance system itself evolves with the project:

#### Phase 1 (Current): Foundation
- All MD files established and integrated
- Basic workflow procedures working
- Human-in-the-loop decision making active

#### Phase 2 (Growth): Automation  
- Automated governance checking tools
- Integration with development tools (git hooks, CI/CD)
- Enhanced workflow automation

#### Phase 3 (Scale): Sophistication
- Advanced metrics and monitoring
- Predictive governance recommendations
- Full integration with development ecosystem

### Continuous Improvement
- Weekly governance effectiveness review
- Monthly file integration validation
- Quarterly governance system evolution
- Annual governance architecture review
