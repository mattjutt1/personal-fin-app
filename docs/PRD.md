## 5. Non-Goals

*   **Enterprise Solution:** This is strictly a personal application, not designed for multi-user, team, or enterprise-level financial management.
*   **Public SaaS:** Not intended to be a publicly available software-as-a-service product.
*   **Direct Bank Integration (Initial Phase):** Direct API integration with financial institutions is out of scope for the initial build to simplify development and focus on core logic. Data import will be file-based initially.
*   **Investment Trading Platform:** This application will provide financial planning and insights, but will not execute trades or manage investment portfolios directly.
*   **Complex Architecture Initially:** Following anti-over-engineering governance principles - Convex-first approach, add complexity only when proven necessary.

## 6. High-Level Technical Considerations

### 6.1 Core Technology Stack
**Governance Compliance**: Following PROJECT_RULES.md anti-over-engineering principles

*   **Frontend:** Next.js (React, TypeScript) for a modern, interactive web UI following Atomic Vertical Slice Hybrid Architecture.
*   **Backend & Database:** **Convex** for real-time database, serverless functions, backend logic, and hosting. This will house the core financial logic and AI agent orchestration.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for simple, maintainable styling without custom CSS complexity.
*   **Architecture:** Convex-first approach with slice-based organization per governance framework.

### 6.2 AI/ML Integration Architecture
**Your Fine-Tuned Models**: Leveraging your Atlas Financial research investment

*   **AI Models:** Your fine-tuned models hosted on Kaggle for free inference:
    - **Budget Specialist**: Your fine-tuned FinMA-7B-NLP 
    - **Investment Specialist**: Your fine-tuned FinMA-7B-Full
    - **Debt Specialist**: Your fine-tuned FinGPT v3.2  
    - **Supervisor Agent**: Your fine-tuned Mistral-7B for orchestration
*   **Integration Pattern:** Convex functions coordinating calls to your Kaggle-hosted models
*   **Local-First Data:** Prioritize local data storage and processing where possible, with Convex providing the cloud synchronization and real-time capabilities.

### 6.3 Governance Integration
**Architecture Compliance**: All development follows established governance framework

*   **Slice Organization:** Features organized by vertical slices (transaction-management, budget-tracking, goal-management) per ATOMIC_VERTICAL_SLICE_HYBRID_GOVERNANCE.md
*   **Quality Gates:** All development follows 8-step validation cycle with evidence-based decision making
*   **Anti-Over-Engineering:** Development constrained by PROJECT_RULES.md - start simple, add complexity only when proven necessary

    description: v.string(),
    category: v.string(),
    date: v.string(),
    type: v.union(v.literal("income"), v.literal("expense")),
    userId: v.optional(v.string()),
  }),
  budgets: defineTable({ /* budget slice data */ }),
  goals: defineTable({ /* goal slice data */ }),
  ai_insights: defineTable({ /* AI coordination data */ }),
});
```

### 9.2 Your AI Model Integration via Convex

// Integration with your fine-tuned models on Kaggle
export const categorizeTransactionWithYourModel = mutation({
  args: { description: v.string(), amount: v.number() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Call your fine-tuned FinMA-7B-NLP on Kaggle
    const category = await callYourKaggleModel("your-finma-7b-nlp", {
      text: args.description,
      context: "transaction_categorization"
    });
    return category;
  },
});

// Supervisor agent coordination
export const getFinancialPlanFromSupervisor = mutation({
  args: { financialData: v.object({}) },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Your fine-tuned Mistral-7B supervisor coordinates other agents
    const plan = await callYourKaggleModel("your-mistral-7b-supervisor", {
      task: "create_financial_plan",
      data: args.financialData,
      available_agents: ["budget", "investment", "debt"]
    });
    return plan;
  },
});
```
